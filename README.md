# Verilog Projects: BINARY TO GREY CODE CONVERTER AND ITS APPLICATION EVEN ODD PARITY CHECKER & GENERATOR #
## **1. Binary to Gray Code Converter** ##
### Project Overview
The Binary to Gray Code Converter converts a given binary number into its
corresponding Gray code. Gray code is a binary numeral system in which two
successive values differ by only one bit.

### Working Principle
- The Most Significant Bit (MSB) of Gray code is the same as the MSB of binary.
- Each remaining Gray bit is obtained by XORing two adjacent binary bits.

**Formula:**
